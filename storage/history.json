      "table_markdown": "**Symptom agent**\nBased on the symptoms you've described, it appears to be a mild upper respiratory infection, likely a common cold. The symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue are typical of a viral infection. The fact that you've had these symptoms for only two days and there's no mention of chest pain or breathing difficulty suggests that the condition is not severe at this point.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if you notice any worsening, such as:\n\n- Increased severity of symptoms\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Chest pain or tightness\n- Fever above 102\u00b0F (39\u00b0C)\n- Severe headache or facial pain\n- Worsening fatigue\n\nGiven the current mild nature of your symptoms, you may not need to see a doctor immediately. But if your symptoms worsen or you're concerned about your condition, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and advice.\n\n**Lifestyle agent**\nGiven your current symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, here are some lifestyle suggestions to help you manage your symptoms and potentially aid in your recovery:\n\n1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut water or sports drinks. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of fluid per day to help thin out mucus and keep your throat moist.\n\n2. **Rest**: Get plenty of rest to help your body fight off the infection. Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night and take naps during the day if needed.\n\n3. **Use a Humidifier**: Dry air can exacerbate a sore throat and cough. Using a humidifier in your home, especially in your bedroom at night, can help add moisture to the air and relieve your symptoms.\n\n4. **Gargle with Salt Water**: Several times a day, gargle with warm salt water to help soothe a sore throat. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water.\n\n5. **Practice Good Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, and before eating. This can help prevent the spread of the infection to others and prevent secondary infections.\n\n6. **Avoid Irritants**: Try to avoid exposure to smoke, dust, and other pollutants that can irritate your nose, throat, and lungs.\n\n7. **Warm Liquids**: Consuming warm liquids like tea, broth, or soup can be soothing and help ease congestion.\n\n8. **Over-the-Counter Medications**: If your symptoms are causing discomfort, you may consider over-the-counter medications like pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) or decongestants. However, always follow the instructions on the label and consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication.\n\n9. **Nutritious Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support your immune system.\n\n10. **Avoid Overexertion**: While it's important to stay active, avoid strenuous activities that can exacerbate your fatigue and potentially worsen your symptoms.\n\nRemember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any concerning signs like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a high fever, seek medical attention.\n\n**Diet agent**\nGiven your current symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, it's essential to focus on a balanced diet that supports your immune system and helps alleviate your symptoms. Here's a suggested diet plan, but please note that this is not a replacement for personalized advice from a dietician or doctor.\n\n**Prefer:**\n\n1. **Warm and Soothing Foods**: Opt for warm, easy-to-digest foods like soups (chicken noodle, vegetable, or lentil), stews, and broths. These can help ease congestion and provide essential nutrients.\n2. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet, such as berries, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and other colorful vegetables. These are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support immune function.\n3. **Whole Grains**: Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat bread, and whole-grain pasta. These provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals that can help alleviate fatigue and support overall health.\n4. **Lean Proteins**: Incorporate lean protein sources like chicken, fish, beans, lentils, and low-fat dairy products. These can help support immune function and provide energy.\n5. **Herbal Teas**: Drink herbal teas like ginger, peppermint, and chamomile, which can help soothe a sore throat and calm your body.\n\n**Avoid:**\n\n1. **Spicy and Acidic Foods**: Avoid spicy, acidic, or sharp foods that can irritate your throat and worsen symptoms. Examples include citrus fruits, tomatoes, and spicy curries.\n2. **Dairy Products with High Sugar Content**: Limit or avoid dairy products with high sugar content, like milkshakes or sweetened yogurts, as they can exacerbate congestion.\n3. **Processed and Fried Foods**: Try to avoid processed and fried foods, which can be high in unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar. These can weaken your immune system and worsen symptoms.\n4. **Caffeine and Alcohol**: Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can dehydrate your body and worsen fatigue.\n5. **Foods High in Salt and Sugar**: Restrict foods high in salt and sugar, like processed snacks, candies, and baked goods, as they can lead to inflammation and weaken your immune system.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, including water, clear broths, and electrolyte-rich beverages, to help thin out mucus and keep your throat moist.\n2. **Eat Small, Frequent Meals**: Divide your daily food intake into smaller, more frequent meals to help manage fatigue and support your immune system.\n3. **Consider Supplements**: If you're struggling to get essential nutrients from your diet, consider consulting with a healthcare professional about supplements like vitamin C, zinc, or probiotics.\n\nRemember, this diet plan is for general guidance only and may not be suitable for everyone. If you have specific dietary needs, allergies, or concerns, please consult with a dietician or doctor for personalized advice.\n\n**Fitness agent**\nGiven your current symptoms of a mild sore throat, runny nose, dry cough, and fatigue, it's essential to prioritize gentle and low-risk physical activities that promote relaxation and support your immune system. Remember to always listen to your body and stop immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort.\n\n**Recommended Gentle Activities:**\n\n1. **Light Stretching**: Engage in gentle stretching exercises, such as neck stretches, shoulder rolls, and wrist extensions, to help loosen up your muscles and improve circulation.\n2. **Short Walks**: Take short, leisurely walks (10-15 minutes) to get some fresh air and gentle exercise. Avoid overexerting yourself, and stop if you feel tired or uncomfortable.\n3. **Yoga or Tai Chi**: Practice gentle yoga or tai chi exercises, focusing on slow, flowing movements that promote relaxation and balance. Avoid any poses that cause discomfort or strain.\n4. **Breathing Exercises**: Engage in deep, slow breathing exercises to help calm your mind and body. You can try inhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, and exhaling for a count of 4.\n5. **Gentle Mobilization**: Perform gentle mobilization exercises, such as ankle rotations, toe wiggles, and finger bends, to help maintain flexibility and range of motion.\n\n**Important Reminders:**\n\n1. **Stop if You Feel Pain or Discomfort**: Immediately stop any activity if you experience pain, discomfort, or shortness of breath.\n2. **Avoid Strenuous Activities**: Refrain from engaging in strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, bending, or high-intensity exercise, as they can exacerbate your symptoms and worsen fatigue.\n3. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to your body's signals, and rest when needed. If you're feeling tired or exhausted, it's essential to prioritize rest and recovery.\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, including water, clear broths, and electrolyte-rich beverages, to help thin out mucus and keep your throat moist.\n5. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: If you have any concerns or questions about your symptoms or physical activity, consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance and advice.\n\nRemember, gentle and low-risk physical activities can help support your immune system and promote relaxation. However, it's crucial to prioritize your comfort and safety above all else. If you experience any worsening of symptoms or concerns, seek medical attention promptly."
